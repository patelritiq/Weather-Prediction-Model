DESCRIPTION: A weather prediction, analyzing and visualization implementation using dataset i.e. weather.csv
GUIDANCE: Zidio Development
DATASET USED: weather.csv
•	Developed a Python-based weather prediction model utilizing tools such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and NumPy while working as a Data Science Intern at Zidio Development.
•	A limited data set was used to train the model for weather prediction and comparison with actual data; future weather prediction may be possible with access to a greater dataset.
•	Developed visuals (graphs, charts, etc.) to look into links among various weather aspects utilizing the model's capabilities.
